# IT-360-Project
Project 11: File encryption, decryption and hashing
In the evolving world of data and information transfer, security of the file contents remain to be one of the greatest concerns for companies. Some information can be password protected (emails, logins) while other information being transferred via emails or FTP lacks efficiency if protected by some keyword. This is where file encryption plays a big role and provides security and convenience sought by parties engaged in file transfers.

In this project you will develop an application where you can select a file and give the choice to the user to compute the hash or to encrypt or decrypt the file. The created hash/encrypted files should be saved to be used for further ceck/decryption. 

*/will be using Python/*
